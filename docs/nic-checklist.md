# Nic's Checklist — Things Only You Can Do

> Claude handles the coding. This file tracks every manual action, setup step, or decision that needs a human. Read this at the start of every session.

_Last updated: 2026-05-11 (feat-assistant-2 — history sidebar implemented; delete button bug added)_

---

## Pending — Next Session

- [ ] **Pre-alpha testing (Session 19)** — all sidebar bugs fixed; app is ready for end-to-end testing.

---

## Done This Session ✓ (2026-05-11, session 3)

- [x] **Fixed assistant history delete button** — root cause: `mousedown` click-outside handler unmounted the dropdown before the `click` event fired on "Delete conversation", so `onDeleteClick` never ran. Fixed by switching to `click` event. Also replaced inline confirm with a proper "Delete Permanently?" modal (No/Yes). Made `deleteChat` idempotent (`!error` only, no count check).
- [x] **Implemented assistant history sidebar** — migrations 0015 (pinned column) + 0016 (RLS delete policy), 3 new API routes (history/pin/delete), HistoryList + HistorySidebar components, mobile `/assistant/history` route, AssistantShell sidebar layout + Suspense boundary. Pushed to dev.

## Done Last Session ✓ (2026-05-11, session 1)

- [x] **Fixed duplicate `asst_chats` saves** — removed `saveConversation` from `sendMessage` in both AssistantShell and FloatingChatPanel; added unmount cleanup to AssistantShell.
- [x] **Deleted `features/chat-thread/`** — empty folder removed; chat stays in `job-detail/ChatSection.tsx`.
- [x] **Deleted `features/completion/`** — empty folder removed; completion logic confirmed in `job-detail/StatusSection.tsx`.
- [x] **Empty `docs/` prefix folders** — already gone (`.gitkeep` files deleted last session).
- [x] **Tightened `settings.local.json`** — `git push` scoped to `origin dev`, ~12 stale one-off entries removed.

---

## Before Pre-Alpha Testing (Session 19) — Must Complete First

- [x] **Run pending DB migrations** — `npx supabase db push` confirmed all migrations (0012–0016) already applied; remote database up to date.
- [ ] **Test Monday digest manually** — run `npm run monday-digest` and confirm it sends to all digest subscribers via Telegram.
- [x] **Obsidian sync — first run** — `greenqubes-kb` added as git submodule at `vault/`; `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` set in `.env.local`; `--use-system-ca` added to all script commands (Node TLS fix); sync confirmed working (`✓ Welcome.md (1 chunk)`).
- [x] **Add production OAuth redirect URI** — added `https://greenqubes-ops.vercel.app/auth/callback` to Supabase Auth → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs. Google Cloud Console only needs the Supabase callback URI (already present).

---

## Before Go-Live (Session 23) — Set Up With Team

- [ ] **Provision team accounts** — Admin → Users tab → Provision new user. Each person must sign in via Google at least once first before you can provision them.
- [ ] **Collect Telegram chat IDs** — each team member messages your bot once; copy their chat ID into their user row from Admin → Users tab → Edit.
- [ ] **Set digest subscribers** — Admin → Digest tab → Subscriber panel → check the box for each person who should receive the Monday digest.
- [ ] **Schedule Obsidian nightly sync** — once manual sync is confirmed working, set up Windows Task Scheduler on the server PC:
  - Program: `node`
  - Arguments: `--env-file=.env.local node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/obsidian-sync.ts`
  - Start in: `C:\Greenqubes_GitHub\greenqubes-ops`
  - Trigger: daily at 2 AM

---

## Security — Do Before Bringing in Any Team Members

- [ ] **Turn on 2FA** on every service account — GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, Anthropic, Cloudflare. Takes 10 minutes. Do this before any team member gets access.

---

## Ongoing — After Go-Live

- [ ] **Review first few Monday digests manually** — confirm what surfaces is worth promoting to Obsidian before trusting the process.

---

## Server PC — Already Set Up ✓

- [x] rclone installed and `greenqubes-r2` remote configured
- [x] `SUPABASE_DB_URL` set as system environment variable (using Supabase Connection Pooler — IPv4)
- [x] Nightly backup scheduled in Task Scheduler at 02:00 — syncs R2 → `E:\Greenqubes-Archive\r2` and dumps DB → `E:\Greenqubes-Archive\db\`
- [x] Git Bash path confirmed: `C:\Git\bin\bash.exe`

---

## Admin Security Note

Admin access is hard-gated to `ai@greenqubes.com` only at both the page and API level. No other account — not even other scheduler accounts — can reach `/admin` or any `/api/admin/*` endpoint. The check is against the Google-authenticated email, not a role field, so it cannot be bypassed by editing `public.users`.
